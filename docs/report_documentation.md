# Reports Overview

Our suite of analytical reports is designed to help you compare bids, identify savings opportunities, assess incumbent performance, and understand supplier coverage within your procurement scenario. Each report uses your input data—such as bids, volumes, prices, and supplier capacities—to produce actionable insights. Whether you are looking to understand your current situation (**"As-Is"**), evaluate optimal outcomes (**"Best of Best"**), apply custom filters and exclusions, or measure supplier coverage, these reports support informed decision-making.

## As-Is

**What it does:**
- Reflects your current award situation without any changes to supplier allocations or prices.  
- Identifies what volume, spend, and savings look like using the incumbent supplier(s) where available.  
- Shows baseline spend and compares it to awarded supplier spend based on existing or "as-is" pricing.  
- Optionally includes “Current Price Savings” to highlight differences between the baseline price and a designated "current price" field.

**When to use:**  
Use the "As-Is" report to understand your status quo. It’s a starting point that helps you see what would happen if you simply continue with existing arrangements without any strategic reallocation or supplier switching.

## As-Is + Exclusions

**What it does:**
- Similar to the standard "As-Is" report, but allows you to exclude certain suppliers or bids based on predefined conditions.  
- If the incumbent supplier is excluded or does not bid, remaining volumes are either left unallocated or reassigned to other valid suppliers (if any).

**When to use:**  
If you have reasons to remove certain suppliers from consideration (e.g., quality issues, compliance requirements, or strategic sourcing rules), the "As-Is + Exclusions" report helps you see the impact on your current scenario while maintaining the same allocation logic.

## Best of Best

**What it does:**
- Identifies the lowest-priced valid bids for each item (or bid ID), regardless of the incumbent, to show the optimal cost scenario if you always chose the cheapest available supplier.  
- Calculates baseline and potential savings if you switched to the best available suppliers for all volumes.  
- Optionally includes "Current Price Savings" if a current price reference is provided.

**When to use:**  
Use the "Best of Best" report to understand the theoretical minimum spend scenario. It’s an ideal reference point for optimal negotiation strategies, showing the maximum possible savings if you allocated each bid to the lowest-price supplier.

---

## Best of Best + Exclusions

**What it does:**
- Incorporates supplier or bid exclusion rules into the "Best of Best" logic. Only suppliers or bids meeting your criteria remain eligible.  
- Shows the best possible outcome while respecting constraints (e.g., excluding certain suppliers or conditions).  
- Volumes that cannot be allocated to a non-excluded supplier appear as "Unallocated."

**When to use:**  
If you want an optimal scenario similar to "Best of Best" but must comply with restrictions or preferences to exclude certain suppliers or sets of bids, this report presents the best possible outcome under those constraints.

## Customizable Analysis

**What it does:**
- Provides a flexible, structured dataset that can be easily imported into Excel or other tools for custom scenario modeling.  
- Includes baseline prices, volumes, and supplier details, and leaves fields like "Awarded Supplier" and certain spend calculations intentionally blank or formula-based.  
- Designed for manual selection and data validation in Excel, allowing you to interactively choose suppliers and view the impact on spend and savings.

**When to use:**  
If you want maximum flexibility to run "what-if" scenarios on your own, the customizable analysis is ideal. It serves as a template you can manipulate, apply formulas to, and fine-tune beyond the constraints of the automated reports.

## Bid Coverage Report

**What it does:**
Comprises multiple sub-reports to assess the competitive landscape and coverage of your bids:

- **Competitiveness Report:** Shows how many potential bids were received, how many had no bids, and where the incumbent failed to submit a valid bid. Identifies the level of competition per grouping (e.g., facility, category).
- **Supplier Coverage Report:** Assesses supplier coverage across all bids and within specific groups. Highlights which suppliers are providing broad coverage and which are not.
- **Facility Coverage Report:** Evaluates bid coverage by facility (or another grouping), showing what percentage of bid IDs each supplier covered.

**When to use:**  
Use these reports to understand market dynamics. If you need insight into how well your suppliers are covering your needs, how competitive each bidding scenario is, or where incumbents or others are not bidding, the Bid Coverage Reports provide the necessary visibility.

## Putting It All Together

- **As-Is / As-Is + Exclusions:** Great for baseline assessments and evaluating changes if certain suppliers are off the table.
- **Best of Best / Best of Best + Exclusions:** Helps you see your theoretical savings potential, guiding negotiations or supplier choices under given constraints.
- **Customizable Analysis:** Empowers you with a flexible playground for tailored scenarios and advanced modeling in Excel.
- **Bid Coverage Reports (Competitiveness, Supplier Coverage, Facility Coverage):** Delivers insights into how competitive and comprehensive your supplier pool is, helping you identify weak spots, non-bidding incumbents, and potential for increased competition.

**In summary:**  
Each report type serves a distinct analytical purpose—from baseline understanding to scenario optimization and strategic supplier oversight. By leveraging these reports, you gain a holistic view of your bidding environment and informed pathways to enhance your sourcing strategy.
